      "In [his book](http://www.computervisionmodels.com/), Prince argues that computer vision should be understood in terms of measurements (images), the world state, a model (defining the statistical relationships between the observations and the world), parameters, and learning and inference algorithms.\n",
      "The presented environment can address all these elements in modern computer vision R&D. Also, such a environment keeps evolving. For example, in the raising field of deep learning vision, packages as [Pylearn2](http://deeplearning.net/software/pylearn2/) and [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) are promising tools that could become an important part of the Python ecosystem for scientific computing in a near future."

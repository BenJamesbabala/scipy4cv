      "Computer vision practitioners need a computing environment that lets them explore data like images, video sequences, point clouds and feature vectors. Such an environment should help on the development and testing of new models and algorithms, and on the deployment of the results, either as a final software module or a scientific/technical publication. It should also provides a *extensive* list of tools, routines for image processing, machine learning, statistical inference, linear algebra, convex optimization and graph algorithms, just to name a few. Problems involving large sets of images can require high-performance computing (HPC) such that the environment should provide practical ways to parallelize and distribute computation. An ideal environment should also combine documentation and computation in a single bundle, promoting results reproducibility, but preventing the research pipeline to become more cumbersome."
